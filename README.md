# Web-Development
* CSS is cascading style sheets <br/>
* It is used to handle the presentation of the website (makes it presentable)containing HTML.<br/>
* It gives style to raw HTML i.e to our web pages and make the websites responsive(convienient on both the laptop and phone)<br/>
->On one side HTML is used to structure a website wheras CSS is responsible for the design.<br/>
* There are basically three ways to add css in markup(HTML CODE):<br/>
* Inline css: CSS is added to elements directly using style attribute.<br/>
* Internal css: CSS is kept inside the head tags in <style> tags.<br/>
* External css : CSS is kept separately inside a .css style sheet.(Preferred)
 ->Selectors :CSS selectors are used to find the element whose property will be set and are used to target the HTML elements(single/Multiple).<br/>
* There are basically four types of selectors: CSS element Selector	,CSS id selector, CSS class and css grouping selector.</br>
* The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. The image below illustrates the box model:</br>
* Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear</br>
* Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent</br>
* Border - A border that goes around the padding and content</br>
* Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent</br>
* CSS Colors -Hex Codes
  A hexadecimal is a 6 digit representation of a color. The first two digits (RR) represent a red
  value, the next two are a green value (GG), and the last are the blue value (BB).
* Types Of Position Property :
  There are five types of position property :
  static,relative,absolute,fixed,sticky

* position: static;
  It is the default position of HTML elements.
* position: relative;
  It is used when we need to position an HTML element relative to its normal position.
  We can set the top, right, bottom, and left properties that will cause the element to adjust away from the normal position.

* position: absolute;
  An element with the absolute position will move according to the position of its parent element.
  In the absence of any parent element, the HTML element will be placed relative to the page.

* position: fixed;
  An element with position:fixed; will remain stuck to a specific position even after the page is scrolled.
  This position property is used when we want to keep an HTML element at a fixed spot no matter where on the page the user is.
